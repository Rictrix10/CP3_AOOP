"1 of the best quotes i heard ""If you spend your life chasing butterflies. Then they will fly away""

""But if you spend your life to make a beautiful garden. They will come by themselves""
 
""If they don't come. You still have a beautiful garden"" focus on ur self not others ."
"Nobody actually cares bro.. just try to be the best version of yourself.. work on yourself.. try to be a better person which will benefit your family and the people you care.. be the guy that likes hardship.

"""Nobody cares, work harder""-It's a liberating statement if you ask me-the only benchmark you should compare yourself to, is only yourself, no one else's opinion matters but my own."
"Every like this comment gets, il do 1 push up, il come back in a week, and how many likes it has il do it"
This is the last summer before I go off to college and sell my free time for the next four years. This is my last chance to get as far ahead as possible compared to my peers. I am not going to disappoint. I started YouTube back in October of 2016 and it took me from that point all the way until February of 2022 to make my first thousand dollars from YouTube. Now I've made $1K in the last 4 days. I hope to make $15K+ this summer. Never give up guys. You will make it if you never give up and truly try your best.
God is the only one we must work to impress
In the beginning of the year I was sooo depressed out of shape no motivation no drive nothing absolutely nothing I had no purpose I didn’t wanna be here someone called me a fatass and something clicked in my head I went and looked at myself in the mirror and decided that I was going to do something with my life I started going to sleep and waking up at a certain time working out taking cold showers reading book once I started to take charge and change my life everything changed things started opening up I got a job and there was a military recruiting office and started talking to them I’m not today sitting at 190 I was 230lb and my whole life has changed I’m soooo happy I didn’t think it was possible to be this happy but don’t confuse that happiness with comfort it’s so uncomfortable but I’ve never been so fulfilled and now I’m going to the army next month
"The sad thing is Kobe saying that then now dosnt matter as he passed away so it proves you have to live your life in the moment now he would give everything to go out with his friends, learn something from that live each day as if it’s your last r.i.p Kobe"
"The problem we have is because Most people always taught that "" you only need a good job to become rich. These billionaires are operating on a whole other playbook that many don't even know exists."
"Couldn't ask for a better advice than this. Its ""midsummer"" here in Sweden, like a holiday with partying and such. The questions comes up here and there ""Why am I sitting here, planning and organizing when everyones having fun?"" - This video was the reminder I needed. Thank you, cheers to you all who keeps grinding!"
"No video has motivated me this much to focus on life telling that life can be unbalanced sometimes and its okay? I wasted more time because I had the guilt of procrastinating a lot but now when im getting the validation that its okay be like this its okay to fuck up and still be back and to be imperfect cause thats how it works im gonna be focused on my life starting tofay and its no joke its not just a high rise of dopamine for a few secs this vodeo makes sense i will rise up on my own 
To everyone watchinh this
""Do not compare yourself with everyone's journey comparison will STEAL your joy. your path doesn't have to be the same to be beautiful"""
Everything you've ever wanted is sitting on the other side of fear.
These really make you think about your life!
Incredibly true! Hard work and relentless dedication are key components of success—maintaining focus and pushing through adversity truly separates the extraordinary from the ordinary. 
Don’t act like your amazing looking at this because your on your damn phone still
"Love you bro... thank you for the video, I just got my hope back for keeping it the fuck going. The opinions of other people and the question "" Am I doing the right thing?"" Got me down sad. You sparked it back up. Thank you."
Remember: You just have one life to live !!!
Good work man 
"People do care: When you become great they begin to either admire you or usually, hate you. If you wish to never offend anyone do nothing, say nothing, be nothing!"
I loved this video! Amazing work truly.
this is beautifully constructed
"Cool video, My relationship of 5 years ended a month ago. The love of my life decided to move on, I really loved her so much i can’t stop thinking about her and the memories we shared. I’ve tried my very best to get her back in my life, but to no avail. I’m frustrated, and i don’t see my life with anyone else. I’ve done my best to get rid of the thoughts, but i can’t. I don’t know why I’m saying this here, but i really miss her and i wish i could get her back."
"Remember to take care of yourself, folks. Burnout is real, too."

One Day or Day One! Restart Day 0.
Does anyone remember or know what Kobe’s daughter sickness was?

How u gon put kevin hart w kobe n david
Unless you live in Vancouver where it's so grey for half the year we don't see no sun.
They do care though. People in this country judge you on how much money you make and how much stuff you have rather than your morals and values and whom you are as a person.
"Kevin "" I got nothin to sell, except my book, my vitamin line & all my other garbage"" Hart"
Well not the whole truth but I really get maaaad.... sometimes and disgusted when you sometimes really can feel how alone you are in the world... guess that SOUNDS PERFECT WITH WORK HARDER!!!
I can’t take Kevin seriously
because i'm trying to get it.
i have mental disability
Nobody cares work smarter!!!!

John 3:16 God is Love Amen

"slaves work hard, hard work has nothing to do with success."
My mom cares tho
"If nobody cared your parents or Guardians would not have raised you. if nobody cared your various teachers would not have taught you. if nobody cared you would have never had a friend. if nobody cared then people would not show up to the grocery stores you shop at. if nobody cared no one would be at the gym that you go to. if nobody cared you would not have gone to the church you went to. if nobody cared no one would have provided you with shelter or clothes or food or things to drink. if nobody cared then there would not be cashiers at gas stations. If nobody cared then there would be no inventions. If nobody cared then there would be no religion whatsoever.
If nobody cared then there would be no philosophy.
There's nobody cared then there would be no libraries.
If nobody cared there would be no police there would be no paramedics or ambulance drivers. It's nobody cared there would be no firefighters.
If nobody cared there would be no therapists there would be no psychologists there would be no counselors.
If nobody cared there would be no psychology whatsoever.
If nobody cared then there would be no people creating all the clothes you wear.
If nobody cared no one would have written a single book. If nobody cared then there would not be so many different types of music movies paintings sculptures masks. If nobody cared then there would be no singers there would be no storytellers.
If nobody cared then there would be no funeral celebrants or funeral officiants.
If nobody cared there would not be any lifeguards at pools or beaches.
If nobody cared there would not be any senators or congressmen or any other type of politicians like mayors or vice presidents or presidents.
If nobody cared there would not be any world leaders.
If nobody cared there would be no innovation in science or health.
Hopefully by now you realize that you can tune down your rhetoric that nobody cares hopefully you have the potential to help others realize the countless ways in which people do care."
"So, the first comment I saw was every like that comment got they would do a push-up, but I didn’t see any proof. So I’ll do the same thing, but I’ll check in two weeks and the video will be posted the next day. Monday the 1st. 01/07/24"
