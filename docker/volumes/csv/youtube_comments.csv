"Watching this, I think a Deadpool cameo would be hilarious... something like ""oops wrong cinematic universe!"""
"I bet Quicksilver is looking down on them saying "" I didn't see that coming "" "
"Iron Man: Stay down. Final warning.

Captain America: I could do this all day

Me: I GOT THAT REFERENCE"
I'm really digging the new Spidey. Can't wait!
"Enjoy the trailer! Don't forget to leave a like! :) 
Viel Spaß mit dem Trailer! Ein Daumen hoch hilft dem Channel sehr weiter, Danke! :)"
OMFG I didn't know that spidey will be in this movie... Can't wait to see it
Calling it now best marvel film ever
"""I can't go to Germany""
""why?""
""I have homework"""
"Can we just take a moment and think about how Iron Man called Spiderman ""Underoos""? :)"
"SPIDERMANNNNNN,NEW TRAILERRRRR LETS GET IT!!!!!!!!!"
I'm rooting for what ever team black panther's on
I honestly cant wait to see Black Panther.
"When I first saw that Spiderman was going to be in this movie, my hopes fell and I thought he would drag the movie down. 

But having seen the movie (twice) I really enjoyed his part. Spiderman didn't over-shadow Captain A or any of the other characters. (Neither did Black Panther, for that matter.) Spidey was funny, he looked awesome doing his web-slinging/kick butt thing, and he brought a youthful vigor to the movie. All in all I thought it looked very authentic. 

What do you guys think?"
They might as well call this movie Clash Of Marvel they have like every superhero ever (which is pretty dope)
Hurry up May 6th! Can't wait to see this one!!
Spiderman looks like the original comic design but without those cute little web wings on his armpits lol
SHIT ITS SPIDERMAN!!!
i choose iron man side
This whole thing is soooo serious and then Spidey makes a bad ass entrance and just say 'Hey everyone!' God he's so cute and shit. Making my heart die slowly in the hollow cavity that is my chest right now FROM ALL THESE FEELS!
i love how spidy is just hey everyone
What if all this conflict between these two heroes are fixed because their mothers coincidentally has the same forename
They shouldn't have put Spiderman in the trailer...
Batman v superman? The biggest gladiator battle ever? No. THIS IS THE BIGGEST AND PROBABLY THE MOST EPIC
"Friend : ""how often do you want to watch this Trailer ?"" Me : ""i Could do this all day"""
Team cap tbh
Toby mquire als spiderman please
yeah spiderman now this is going to be fun!
Spider-man: Homecoming trailer today! HYPE
Spidey: Hey everyone. lol only spidey can pull that off.
"When Cap said he could do this all day, i must admit, I sobbed. Who else?"
This is freaking amazing.
"Spider-Man would never just be like ""hey everyone ."" Come on ! Lmao"
I didn't know spiderman was in this. Now I am definitely watching this
cant wait until to see this
It's a perfect trailer. Watching this I feel it should be the best movie of 2k16
Truly hope Cap knocks that self-righteous streak out of Iron Man.
"Grabs Cap's Shield.
""Hey everyone."""

"stupid costume for SPIDERMAN, too much CGI , bad logo, ruined ant man scene in trailer"
OMG SO HYPE
The way spider man is like 'hey everyone' XD
"i'm still hoping that FOX and disney will set aside their differences and give us avengers vs x-men,yeah and put deapool in it the ultimate game changer"
that fourth wall stuff of calling Spidey 'underroos' just kills it
this is going to be epic!!!!!
"2:19

"No, the first two trailers were all right and the third trailer didn't break my heart either :) OFCOURSE IT DID! THE FIRST ONE BROKE MY HEART IN A MILION PIECES AND THEY HAD TO MAKE A SECOND AND THIRD SO I WOULD TOTALLY CRASH... I'm fine"

"30: 00 Scarlet witch looks sad. if you remember this is one year in the future, also one year after her brother Quicksilver died. Cap ""OK, thats enough."" she's obviously earned his Trust. and it's obvious that she's not going to side with Stark."
"holy fucknuggets, Spiderman"
ITS SPODERMAN :D
Anyone else see bucky with no arm at 2:05? XD IRONMAN blasted it off!
I am seriously going to freak out when I see this and Spiderman comes on the screen
"I watch this 20 minutes ago proper brilliant if you didn't watch the film watch it it's worth it better then DC am mavel fan all the way stan Lee,the crew and the actors did brilliant  new spider man and ant man  crack me up every time lol well done massive around of the cause "
"Tony: ""We need to be put in check.""Me: ""I thought you were a genius, and it doesn't even take a genius to figure out that the problem is not the heroes, but the villains. Let's put the bad guys in check and then the heroes won't be blamed for all the collateral damage.""Me: ""Or, you know, we could do your plan and then let the bad guys just win and cause even more deaths."""

Only Vision could take on the entire Capt. team< don't you think so?
team captain America

Spider-Man will find a way... hopefully it is a good one.

Iron Man vs Captain America is a fight is a no-brainer. There is nothing Capt. America could do to hurt Iron Man.
Spidey changes sides and kicks fucking arse
ya spider man is in it he's my favorite hero
UNDEROOS!!
Funny how your voice sounds different when it's played back to you.
2:12 What does Ironman yell right before spiderman comes in?

Good this ant man scene
My thoughts: STOP PUTTING HOLES IN MY SHIP
Spiderman! finally this movie just became more phenomenal. I can't wait! Bad choice of logo for Spiderman...
The voice for Spiderman sounds familiar
tom holland is playing  spidey and the trailer is fucking amazing cant wait!  TeamIronman
"Yes, Ultron (Sokovia) was the hubris of Tony and Bruce, 99% of all the horrors the Sokovia Accord are addressing were brought about by HYDRA, not S.H.I.E.L.D., and this ""Civil War"" is a result of HYDRA's culminations towards the destruction of both the Avengers AND the world. While I am #TEAMIRONMAN, I'm still an Avenger in my spirit, and believe in their charter and cause."
chida
Ughh Spider-Man is bae asf
the trailer before this was for Civil War :P
Team cap 4ever
I NEED TO SEEE THISSSUDUDHDFUDUDJF

Hate me for this but just that last scene of Spiderman looks way better than everything Amazing Spiderman 2 was.
Im in #teamcap
I Watch It
i was on cap A's Side until i saw spiderman. i was like SCREW CAP A IRONMAN TEAM GO
"if you pause at 2:05 right before cap hits ironman, you can see bucky's body"
"I want see this video,how to do"
"Comic book wise, Ironman but this movie I'm going for Cap."
"what the hell its spider man
its epic superheroes movies everrrrrrr"
#Team cap    even because team iron man has spider man crossbone and a lot more advantage
#team iron man. but i feel that the vision spiderman and black panther will carry the team
"anyone else think civil war is gonna turn out like age of ultron? where an age was more of a week, so this ""war"" is gonna be more like a battle or brawl"
QUICKSILVER PLZ BE IN THIS MOVIE
They should have had the amazing Spider-Man do this movie
I noticed that war machines arch reactor light is not shown when he gets shot down. but when the 2 teams are running at each other his arch is a bright yellow. .hmmmm
Brilliany-the powers are a lbig uplift-but not stupid uplift-and they are together. They will rwhile the God Powers are away
#teamcap
I'm rooting for what ever team black panther's on
Can't wait to see Spidey on the big screen

"What if Deadpool was there?
He would kick both sides' butts and then slink away laughing lawl"

Damn I look good!
They better not kill off War Machine.
SPIDER MAN!!!!!!!! OMFG

La mejor escena es cuando el Spidey aparece. He dicho.

"""I'm not the one who needs to watch their back."" who wanna bet that she's spying on Tony for Cap (I still find it difficult to believe she's on Team Iron Man."
#TeamIron
haha lol i fucking died
"Does anyone remeber the little kid from iron man 3, i have a feeling he is spiderman now"
this should have been an avengers movie not just labeled Cap. America i mean we pretty much see most of the avengers in this including spidey not really liking his new costume though he should've gotten an iron spider look if he is on tony's side
#teambatman
This is just Avengers: 3 Featuring Spiderman!
I can't be the only one who can't choose a side. XD it's just so hard to decide
It's bird no it's a plane no superman   NO! it's SPIDER-MAN
how about a third team. deadpool wolverine blade black cat thor & hulk.
im calling it now after stark almost gets shot by bucky in head he's gonna say a cheesy one liner
ahhh its spidy

this trailer shows everything in the movie im feeling bad for marvel they show to mutch. this plot is strong but not enought will be a little better than winter soldier
"oh great spider man..  nigga was like ""hey everyone"".. smh"
spidey came in strong
why does spiderman talks like himgosu
1:51 Who is that? Scarlet Witch?
spiderman should have had a better suit...i mean he's with shield now
Is anyone else bothered that Spiderman sounds younger than he should be?
Spiderman sounds like a little boy
UNDEROOOOOOS
spider man wow???

oh my fucking gwaaaad
who is that punching capt.  in the silver mask?

Am I reading into it or is Team Iron Man representing oppressive regimes vs Team CAP representing victimized people
SPIDER MAN OMG.....!

Am I the only one who thinks Crossbones shot War Machine?
wow spider man come to
"well, there goes individual spiderman movies, then.."

I thought Black Panther would be with Captain America. Anybody agree?
jane bowen that is not nice to say to me a not so comment. that makes me cry start to close to that nicely. I am not dumb.
Nobody would beat Idris's Shere Khan. He should be the next Bond villain if he aint the hero in link with Liam Neeson. They are physical natural. Jamaica. IRA no gym hell. Hand size is it. in this gym age
spider man finally fucking made it.
"Is this real? This movie will have Spider Man. I think Spider Man in SONY STUDIO, not MARVEL, RIGHT?"
#TeamCap sorry tony!!! >.<
Tony is saying that cap is out of control yet he's the one who created ultron???
Hey everyone
Hey everyone
Hey everyone
Team Iron Man
"Everyone what, lil boy?"
Team cap

hulk missing??? 
Antman!!!!!
does realy spidey eyes should move like that???? i mean i've read some of the comics and watch the old cartoons but i may be wrong should his eyes realy have to move like that??? xDDDD
omggggggggggg
what did spider man just say ? I could not understand the dialogue !!
iron man is the best
is it just me or does spider man's costume look bare weird
That ain't Spiderman. It's a cartoon.
"Marvel seriously only want 1 Spider-man, choosing a 19 year old for the role kind of reminds me of Ultimate Spider-man as Peter was a roughly that age in the ultimate universe....so i feel Marvel are going down that route with Spider-man"
i look at this trailer and at 2:19 im like that could've been Andrew Garfield :(
 yes Spider-Man omg yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas
is this real?
No wonder Spider-Man is on ironman side cuz cap America has 1. More on his side
Can someone tell me what ironman called spiderman at2:14
i choose captain america side..
This new film projector month in Vietnam
Why do trailers always have to show way too much these days? Jesus!
"Andrew Garfield must turn on his grave...

oh wait he is not dead yet..."
"it doesn't make any sense , that black widow is on iron mans team instead of Captain America"
shut up and take my money
only thing that can be more badass than marvel avengers is Shonen Jump Avengers...xDD
"I honestly think Spidey can be better and that he should at least said something different than just a ""Hey Everyone"" like cmon Spidey would say something way better"
00:30 sorry
Let's face it if your still in 2016 making bieber jokes just admit you love him.
Don Cheadle dies in the movie.

"Ok, I need a little help here. It's just a suit, isn't it? Why can Spider Man move his eyes???"
Winter soldier killed ironman's parents. Spoiler alert!
"love spidey, but he seems a bit outgunned in this one."
"4 characters that should be in the movie

loki"
Why's dose Spider-Man sound like justin beiner
